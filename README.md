# Instagram-Follower-Count

This Python project is an interactive Higher-Lower game where players guess which celebrity, 
influencer, or public figure has more social media followers. Two random accounts are displayed 
with their name, profession, and country, and the player must choose between them. Correct guesses 
increase the score, and the game continues until the player makes a mistake.

The program uses functions for modular design, including data formatting and answer validation, 
while relying on randomization to select accounts from a dataset. The game also maintains a running 
score, providing feedback after each guess to enhance engagement and replayability.

This project highlights key programming skills such as dictionaries, loops, conditionals, modular 
functions, and user interaction. It also incorporates real-world-style datasets to simulate comparisons 
in social media metrics, demonstrating how data can be used to create engaging games and applications.

Beyond its educational value, the project reflects real-world scenarios like social media analytics, 
gamified data comparison tools, and interactive learning apps, making it both fun and practically relevant.
